    <string name="lorem_ipsum">Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry\'s standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</string>

    <string name="about_page_text">Hello everyone! \n\nI am very happy to be able to deliver this application to you as a result of long-term studies. I tried to develop an application that can help anyone who loves books. And I want it to become even more useful by adding new features over time. The application is completely free and ad-free. And I plan to always stay that way -but you never know what future brings-. \n\nEndless thanks to my wife Sümeyra, my brothers Fatih, Ahmet Haşim and my sister Eda, my mom Fatma and my dad Namık who have always supported me and believed in me throughout this process and of course my son Selim for always giving me strength and joy in life. \n\nThanks to Atıl Samancıoğlu, Akın Kaldıroğlu and Philipp Lackner, from whom I learned and understood a lot with his lectures, videos and articles during the software learning and development process -probably they don’t know about it though-. \n\nThanks also to the amazing people on Youtube and StackOverFlow whose names I can\'t remember. \n\nSpecial thanks to my brother Ahmet Haşim, who was my mentor throughout this whole process. \n\nI hope you like the application. You can always reach me at ofdelibas@gmail.com for complaints, requests, bug reports and similar things.</string>
